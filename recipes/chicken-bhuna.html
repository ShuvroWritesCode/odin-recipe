    <h3 class="title">Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken Bhuna is a flavorful and aromatic Indian dish that hails from the rich culinary traditions of the Indian subcontinent. This dish features succulent pieces of chicken that are marinated and then cooked to perfection in a thick, spicy, and well-seasoned tomato-based gravy. The term "bhuna" refers to the cooking technique in which the spices are sautéed and simmered until they release their full flavor, resulting in a deep and intense taste profile.</p>
