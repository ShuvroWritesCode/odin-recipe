    <h3>Recipe</h3>

        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <p>Heat a skillet coated with cooking spray over medium heat; fry paneer cubes until lightly browned on each side, about 5 minutes. Transfer paneer to a bowl.</p>

        <strong>Step 2</strong>

        <strong>Step 4</strong>
        <p>Transfer spinach mixture to a blender or food processor; puree until smooth.</p>

        <strong>Step 5</strong>
        <p>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil in a saucepan over medium heat; add spinach puree and paneer cubes. Simmer until hot, about 5 minutes.</p>
