    <p>Butter Chicken, also known as Murgh Makhani, is a renowned and indulgent Indian dish that has gained international popularity. This flavorful and creamy delicacy originates from North India and is celebrated for its rich, velvety tomato-based curry.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 large skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry paste</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons tandoori masala</li>

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <p>Heat butter and vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in chicken, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, curry paste, curry powder, tandoori masala, and garam masala until no lumps of tomato paste remain.</p>

    
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
        <p>Pour mixture into a slow cooker; stir in cardamom pods, coconut milk, and yogurt. Season with salt.</p>
    
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
        <p>Cook on High for 4 to 6 hours (or on Low for 6 to 8 hours) until chicken is tender and sauce has reduced to desired consistency. Remove and discard cardamom pods before serving.</p>
